# Howling Oats Brewery
Beer Company Group Project - first milestone.
### Description
This application is the howling oats brewery website. We each had a page we worked on. We used git to merge our branches into master and learned how to overcome merge conflicts. This project was an exercise in bootstrap, printing to dom, arrays and array methods, nav bars, SPAs, and dynamic event listeners
All pages feature page header with logo, nav bar, and footer.Nav bar uses click events to add/remove classes on individual pages to display the selected page and hide the others.The home page features a form. When form is filled out and submit is clicked, alert appears confirming submission.

Home page also features Bootstrap photo carousel set to 3 second intervals. Captions, alt text,a nd titles have been added to images.

Brewmasters page features cards formed from brewmasters array which are printed to the DOM. Each image has attached title and alt text.

Events page features Bootstrap cards formed from events array and printed to DOM. Each image has alt text and title.

The Buy Beers page features bootstrap cards formed from the beer array and printed to the dom. Each image has alt text and title. The merchandise page has a cart feature where you are able to add an item to the cart and the cart adds up the total.
